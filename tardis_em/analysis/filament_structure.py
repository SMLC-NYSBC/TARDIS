def assign_filaments_to_poles(filaments, poles):
    """
    Assigns filaments to the closest poles and potentially flips their orientation to maintain consistency
    based on proximity to the assigned pole.

    The function processes a set of filaments, identified by unique IDs, and calculates their start and end points.
    Distances from these points to given poles are computed, and each filament is assigned to the nearest pole.
    If needed, the points of a filament are reordered to ensure that their orientation starts closer to their assigned pole.
    Filaments are then grouped according to their assigned pole.

    :param filaments: A 2D NumPy array where each row contains information about an individual
        point of a filament. The first column represents the filament ID, and the
        remaining columns represent the position coordinates of the point.
    :param poles: A 2D NumPy array where each row contains the coordinates of a pole.
    :return: A tuple containing two arrays. The first array represents the filaments assigned
        to the first pole, while the second array represents the filaments assigned to the
        second pole. Each filament is listed with its points in correct order to maintain
        proximity to the assigned pole.
